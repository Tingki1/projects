2,2022-02-25,,Food left on the grass median strip in the rain,After a 1.5h wait the restaurant claimed it was delivered and we find it in a paper bag in the pouring rain on the grass outside the gate. Offered a $5 credit. Pathetic,1
3,2022-02-25,SA,Order not delivered,"Would rate no star but wont accept less than one star.The online order stated was dropped off. Went to check front door not there, check side of the house not there. No car even showed up at the address to deliver order.Tried to  contact Uber but of course no number to call them. Went and did the online ""get help"" because order not delivered, but useless because something was wrong on their end, when it came to giving me a refund.All in all very poor service.",1
4,2022-02-23,WA,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE,"It’s been tough as a full time worker to order a simple food at the end of the day…Prices are extremely high, they don’t offer $0 delivery fees, they charge 30% on the deliveries and there’s 2 fees to apply on top of your order… honestly a simple burger and chips or a kebab with fries end up costing almost $40.. ?????I’m honestly frustrated with all food delivery services.. I’m over this!",2
5,2022-02-21,VIC,Uber Eats now unusable in the Dandenong Ranges,"Uber Eats used to be great - prompt delivery, no troubles at all.  In the past six months though, it's become unusable in the Dandenong Ranges; my last few orders have been cancelled some time *after* they were due to be delivered, presumably because there were no drivers available.  I've entirely stopped using them, because I have a young family to feed, so I need reliable service.",1
6,2022-02-20,,Abysmal.,My young families order did not exist yet charged me for it! Only when the order did not show it turns out Uber eats have given out a poorly working tablet to the local takeout (they are very good).,1
7,2022-02-18,QLD,"Wait hours for the order to not even show up, support useless, dogshit service.","Wait hours for the order to not even show up, support useless, dogshit service. old mates probably just ran off with a free feed because it tracked the order pretty much all the way to my unit then the driver has taken off, so yeh useless waste of  time service. use menulog instead.",1
8,2022-02-18,,The worst,"Uber eats is the worst service now. Can take 2 hours with cold food. No response to complaint, no delivery drivers nearby, stop offs on the way. I'm out. Hi door dash",1
9,2022-02-18,,An absolute loser of a driver,He spent forever going the wrong way! Never ever will use Uber eats again. Our food was cold. It was a complete disaster and he had no idea how to use a map!!,1
10,2022-02-16,NSW,Always stuffing up the order,"I am sick to death of constantly receiving incorrect orders and orders with missing items. The delivery drivers always relinquish themselves of responsibility and tell me to call the restaurant. The restaurants always confirm that they gave the driver the full and correct order. Given that this happens more often than not, and with various reputable restaurants, I am inclined to believe the restaurants. Yes, you can claim a refund through the app but it is still a major inconvenience. This service claims to deliver your order to your doorstep and they have failed to do so on too many occasions.",1
11,2022-02-16,,Terrible customer service. Sent wrong item,Terrible customer service. I was Sent wrong item and have to jump through many many hoops to get a refund. Avoid and use another platform with actual contactable customer service.,1
12,2022-02-16,,Crappiest business of all times. Always ends up cancelling orders. Why commit if you can’t deliver. Hopeless business,They always accept the order and end up cancelling it in about 2 hours. End up wasting so much time wherein I could have arranged something alternatively. Ridiculous customer service as well with no compensation for the time wasted. I have had to ho hungry multiple nights due to their negligence.,1
13,2022-02-14,NSW,Warning! Terrible take away app and terrible customer sevice,"We’ve just encountered an awful experience tonight with Uber eats.Waited more than an hour and half ago,The order never came.The order was then canceled without any explanation or contact.Tried to contact Uber eats support but difficult to get in touch with them, the only number we could find on the website is for Uber rider and Uber eats delivery person.We are disgusted with their customer service(which I don’t think it ever exited).I would definitely not suggesting the app to anyone!",1
14,2022-02-12,NSW,Dinner delivery cancelled after an hour and a half wait,"They cancelled my delivery as couldn't find a driver. Great! I wish there was a least someone to speak to regarding the issue.Will never use you again! Terrible, absolutely terrible",1

16,2022-01-30,SA,Awful,Awful experience every time. Woeful platform that really does not work with no one to talk to. Do not use Uber Eats. I must have 30 words so here you go.,1
17,2022-01-28,VIC,Ordering and not divering,"Hi. I'm not even sure who is responsible for this situation. It been happened several times,  we are ordering food, usually after a difficult day at work,  or for an occasion,  we're waiting 30 min., 40 min., and after thar the order is canceled! Today we did it twice,  both orders are canceled after a long waiting time! Please, if you can't manage it, tell us from the beginning! After two hours my kids still hungry and I have to go for shopping and cook something!",2
18,2022-01-27,VIC,Would give 0 stars if I could will never use again,"Worst company ever i have write 30 words  , just like to say I don’t like eating cold food Get you business in order get some decent staff and stop stuffing people around",1
19,2022-01-27,VIC,Cold food due to multiple pick ups,Hey Uber Eats. If you want to keep on profiting from doing nothing I suggest you pay your drivers more and stop them from doing multiple pickups. Food gets delivered cold.Paying a premium to order from you only makes sense if the service and the food gets to you hot and in a timely manner. Do better or people will jump ship and stop using your service.Hope for your sake and your profits you get better at doing what you promise.,1
20,2022-01-27,VIC,Driver fraud,"Map showed driver was on our street, got warning from Uber Eats to give driver a moment.......and out of the blue, driver cancels the order and left us in the lurch.  I assume the driver got a nice free dinner from Carluccis and Carluccis was left out of pocket.  Uber Eats doesn't even allow me an opportunity to communicate with them.",1
21,2022-01-27,,Unreliable and terrible customer service,Took 1.5 hours after it said it was 40 minutes max food came Cold and stale and when asked about the extra waiting time support simply ignore the issues and gave excuses regarding the higher fee cost,1
22,2022-01-26,,Uber delivery is bad.,Uber eats delivery was great when our restaurant started using them. Now they take multiple orders and our customers get cold food. 30% fee we expect better from Uber as restaurants as well as customers are paying them to ensure food arrives hot. We don't make the food unless a driver is assigned so it's hot when it leaves the store and cold when customers get it they're charging more money to customers to prioritize their order so drivers can now cancel an accepted order to take the higher paying one leaving us with cold food we now must remake when a new driver is assigned. This is price gouging at its finest Uber needs to step up or step off.,1
23,2022-01-24,VIC,Order and never arravied,"I ordered Uber Eats from Mango Thai Montrose at 610 saying that it would be delivered within 45 min. The app showed the meal was ready and waiting to to picked up. After half an hour I rang the driver who said the meal hadn’t even been prepared as yet, he put me on to the restaurant who was happy to cancel",1
24,2022-01-22,,Cold Food like eating leftovers,"No criticism about the food provider but Uber Eats delivered it so cold I may as well have brought it at lunch time to eat it at dinner time. Driver advised that she was sent to the other side of town first (restaurant is 5min drive from us, driver sent 30min away as priority) before delivering ours. Will not use again, a good meal destroyed by a terrible delivery company. Will never use Uber Eats again, tried once and a horrible experience",1
25,2022-01-22,,Cold food always,"Ubereats is paying drivers too low they got no choice so they are picking up multiple orders at once and food is delivered stone cold always, Ubereats is slavery for poor drivers",1
26,2022-01-21,QLD,Terrible service and terrible customer support,"Waited over a hour for my delivery food was stone cold delivery drivers are rude and unprofessional wanted to leave my food in the rain cause they didn't want to get wet walking up stairs, not only did the driver decided to take a second delivery and in a complete different suburb which dragged the time then proceeded to take the scenic route adding 10mins to the delivery will never use agian and when I complaint they didn't want anything to do about it I include both pictures of the food and the drivers route it it was Inadequate proof 70 dollars down the drain.",1
27,2022-01-21,NSW,Order cancelled after waiting 65 minutes,Placed my order at 7:10pm with an estimated time of 7:50 which moves to 8:10pm and then at 8:10 the estimated time changed to 8:20. At 8:14pm the order was cancelled. This is about the 7th time in the last 6 months.,1
28,2022-01-19,WA,fees fees and hidden fees,"phenomenal charges now. uber wants 24.50 for the order plus 2.45 service plus 5.99 delivery thats 32.94 total . Bit much for Guzman y Gomez thats 600 mts  away , so I decided to get it myself. Total cost 19.90 and 10 minutes walk. So uber not only adds on a service charge and delivery They also added 4.90 onto the food cost . Total uber gets 13.04 . PS dont forget the TIP wondering now WHO gets the tip.",2
29,2022-01-18,,No customer support,"Whenever I complained of my food arriving late and cold or one time it had a hair, the response was nothing we can do. Not good enough I’m not wasting my money there anymore to receive unsatisfactory food.",1
30,2022-01-18,QLD,Keep cancelling orders and no refunds/take months to refund,"Uber eats as of recently almost every order I've made they have cancelled and usually without explanation. The refund process takes longer than it should or sometime none at all and IF they approve using PayPal have had to get PayPal to reimburse on their behalf, with the in app telling me I owe money because they cancelled and took my money, stating I can't make further orders because they didn't want to reimburse $20 they took from me without any explanation? Not to mention I have waited hours in the past with multiple drivers accepting the o...",1
31,2022-01-17,NSW,Worst food delivery service there is,Food always arrives cold as there is multiple deliveries. Drivers do not give 2 craps and will just decide not to pick it up if they can't be bothered. Waited 2 hours once just to have a driver not even drive to the restaurant. Save your time and money and use doordash or menulog,1
32,2022-01-15,SA,Over it,"Too many times the food arrives luke warm due to delays in delivery or I am second in line of two deliveries (even once the driver went to another restaurant to pick up an order before delivering mine even though they went passed my house).  With such exorbitant delivery and service fees PLUS the price of the food is more expensive than what it would be if you went to the restaurant yourself, I am done receiving substandard food for at an exorbitant cost...I have deleted the app",1

35,2022-01-12,,Worst customer service,Poor service all round - seems to be getting worseConstant app errors/glitchesLittle to no support - generic copy/paste responses which drive you to insanityThey let the restaurants run their business and step back and take the money so service is always inconsistent.Greedy - keep adding hidden fees and this ‘priority’ gimic is fraudulent at best - it does nothing to speed up the process whatsoever and is just a way to grab extra money for the same service.Highly frustrating service to use and deal with.NOT CONSUMER FOCUSSEDI feel for the delivery people who likely put up with the same issues,1
36,2022-01-11,VIC,Lousy customer service,More and more negative experiences with these food delivery services. Most recent experience having tracked a driver right outside my house and complete the order without actually receiving my food. Tried to get in contact with driver and he could not speak enough English to be able to communicate what happened. Just understood he made a “mistake and gave my order to someone else” and refused to get my order back and deliver.There’s no call centre so you in circles trying to get issue resolved but their way of resolving issue is just to refund which takes up to 10 days.So infuriating. Lousy lousy lousy!,1
37,2022-01-11,,"Was good, now bad","Use to be great when it first came out. But now days they slap prices on everything. First there's delivery, which i understand. Then service fee and now thet have priority which is $5. Never had problems with it before but now if you dont click it  you always have to wait for them to make another delivery.  Just the standard corporate fat cats seeing dollar signs",1
38,2022-01-11,,Will never use Uber eat again!,The Food was ready and sitting in the restaurant for 2 hours waiting for a Uber driver to pick up. Might as well we go to pick up by ourselves.,1
39,2022-01-11,,A scam,"Delivery address was incorrect. No way to correct it, every time tried it came back with ‘Oops, can’t perform this task’ No option but to cancel order. Charged a ‘cancellation fee’ of the price of the whole order even though cancellation was less than 2 minutes after order was placed. No way to contact Uber eats for refund, just a frustrating circle. I cannot believe this company‘a business model is legal.",1
40,2022-01-10,,Zero Stars,You are better off driving to the restaurant yourself to collect.,1
41,2022-01-09,,Bad service,It’s impossible to get any customer service after they stuff  up your order . I hate ordering online . It’s always a risk . I have to wait 3 days for a delivery fee refund  even when it was Uber’s fault . I also lost the free 30 voucher the Uber had given me. I’ll never use Uber eats again,1
42,2022-01-08,QLD,Expensive experience,I ordered $115.00 of pizza from DOC PIZZA Carlton tonight.  Food was completely COLD in boxes.  Must have been pre cooked.   NOT fault of driver as tracking showed delivery straight  from restaurant to home.  No more on line ordering from that company.,1
43,2022-01-06,VIC,Warning! Do not order from Ubereats!,"They are thieves who will steal your money and when they cannot deliver and cancel the order, you wont get your money back either.  There's no customer support and they copy and paste email support.  I have lost more than $50 and have waited a long time for my refund. I can't contact their CEO. Please do not ever order from them. PERIOD!",1

45,2022-01-04,,Greedy + undeserving of our business,"They used to be a speedy delivery service. Now, drivers are assigned MULTIPLE orders on route, meaning your food sits in their car for over an hour getting cold. I ordered food to my location from a south eastern location. Driver picks it up, THEN DRIVES 15 MINUTES FURTHER SOUTH to grab another order from another restaurant. Food reciept states it was made at 5:21pm. We received it at 6:40pm, cold and soggy as anything. HORRIFIC",1
46,2022-01-04,,Appalling,I ordered from a restaurant my delivery guy went two streets in the opposite direction after they picked up my order and it was not kept at the required temperature. So i was unable to eat it. Will not be using uber eats again.,1
47,2022-01-03,NSW,Probably the best out of a bad bunch,Ordered food was given an estimate which was then pushed out multiple times then cancelled. At least my money was returned promptly and an apology was given. As for Deliveroo they have got to be the worst followed closely by Menulog. They used to be all pretty good in my area but I have given up and walk or drive and pick up my own ordersJason,1
48,2022-01-03,,Horrible service,Order canceled after delaying multiple times for 2 hours.Why accept orders in the first place if 'could not be delivered'.Incompetent customer service.Not worth paying extra for service fees.,1

Order was pushed back in time twice and by the time it got here the ice blocks melted and wrong item. No contact apart from the in app help that doesn’t help at all and then ignores messages. Now I’m being told after they have taken my money that I have to wait for a response. This is once again theft! Take my money and give me bad service and then make me wait for a refund of incorrect items. Not happy this will be the 3rd time I’ve dele...",1
50,2022-01-03,NSW,Driver too drunk to drive!,Driver sent wife and kids to pick up order from Liquorland Asquith because he was too drunk to drive. Ultimately order was cancelled as Uber Eats could not find a replacement driver. Will never use this service again as competitors are professional and reliable.,1
51,2022-01-03,,Disgraceful service,"There never seems to be available drivers anymore, and yet delivery charges are higher than ever. Placed an order from dominos in st kilda east today, which never got delivered but conveniently wasted no time in taking the funds out of my account. Store is not answering, and impossible to get through to an ubereats representative to get this sorted/refunded. After too many issues, and with this final issue that still isnt resolved being the final straw, This will be the last time I used UberEats.",1
52,2022-01-03,NSW,Hopeless app.,Order did not arrive. Will never use again. Found message later saying order cancelled for no reason given. Don't bother using until they get their act together. Someone needs to read these reviews and act.,1

68,2021-12-26,QLD,Losing my patience with UberEats,"I recently ordered a burger, chips and wings from a local restaurant that I have visited in person before and I know the food is very good. However, when I ordered food through UberEats from this restaurant it placed my order behind someone else who order something from a completely different restaurant.

76,2021-12-23,QLD,Overpriced food delivery,"Uber Eats is an overpriced food delivery service. The prices of individual items are more expensive on the app than in restaurant. On top of this, they charge a delivery fee and a service fee. If you want your delivery to arrive at a reasonable time, you have to pay a 'prompt delivery' fee. If you don't pay this fee then expect your delivery to take a minimum 1 hour to be delivered. They won't be receiving any tips from me in the foreseeable future.",1

Drinks have turned up spilled to the point where there is basically no drink left. This is unacceptable and will never be using it again. I am quite disappointed in the lack of service. I strongly do not recommend uber eats to anyone. Not worth your time.,1

Funds were refunded however this is not good enough for a company that's sole job was to deliver food. The poor restaurant had even made the food, Uber just couldn't get a driver! Perhaps pay your staff more to improve your service. I'll never order from them again as the delivery fee and service fee does not match the service provided.",1
86,2021-12-20,,Ubereats very expensive,Complete ripoff. Food gets charged $2.50 more plus $1.50 service plus $6 delivery for a distance of 700 metres. I can't select a pickup. Ubereats made the app so I have to get the food delivered if you select a popular and well known fast food restaurant. So that's almost double the price. Only using ubereats because work used to give vouchers for doing OT. Now they stopped using ubereats vouchers after numerous complaints. Can't wait until I finished using all the vouchers and good riddance to ubereats. I would give them a zero if I could.,1

Fake trip km, fake supplement pay, app gps is stupid, my phone gets really hot.You get paid $5 per delivery and $3 additional delivery, some order at Maccas can make you wait up to 1 hour. Just get a normal job",1
165,2021-11-10,QLD,Will not use UberEATS again,"Waited for five hours for food to arrive, horrible customer service who refused to cancel the order till midnight. Have uninstalled the app, I won't be using the service again",1
166,2021-11-09,VIC,Takes too long expensive for service,"Unless you pay extra for a priority service you end up waiting longer due to delivery drivers having an extra stop. We won’t bother the next time, everything is close enough that we can pick it up ourselves. Fuel costs much less than the delivery fee and at least our food will still be hot!",1
167,2021-11-08,,They just keep adding more fees for a longer delivery?? Makes no sense,"80% of the time the delivery takes extremely long unless your paying $3 for priority, or some of the food is missing. I don’t think I’ll ever use Uber again. They just keep money grabbing with all these silly fees, service fee and a delivery fee? Isn’t the service the delivery? End up paying $10 on all the fees, would rather put an extra $10 petrol in my car, drive and pick it up myself.Seriously disappointing Uber, get your thing together. Maybe you should read some of these reviews and make some improvements.",1
168,2021-11-08,NSW,Never again,Uber eats has gotten so badConstantly waiting over a hour for cold foodHaving the audacity to charge extra so you dont have to wait longer for foodOver charging on food and deliveryCancelling orders an hour plus after orderingThe divers are usually rude and incompetentCant get through to customer service,1
169,2021-11-08,,Free delivery is a scam and false advertising,"Advertised free delivery but additional $4.50 added at checkout. Rip off false advertising. So again screw uber and their false advertising scamming baseless delivery process. Your change in business operation over the last year hasn't been overlooked, you lying scurvy dogs.",1
170,2021-11-08,NSW,Pretty much a joke now,"Inc accidentally went with uber eats this evening for a pizza instead of Deliveroo or Doordash. Exact same item, $5 more. Really disgusting at this point. They also have just about the worst customer service I've ever experienced. What a joke this company is now.",1
171,2021-11-07,VIC,I picked up my order after an hour of no action,Shame on you Uber Eats. App deleted ✌️,1
172,2021-11-07,,Like watching a kettle boil. Just waiting for my order to be cancelled again.,"Ordered around 10, 30 minutes later tried to contact support to cancel. Got no response I was 3rd in line then got a message saying sorry just reply to our email, waited again in line after 45 min was told driver was assigned then got a notification that it was cancelled. I feel worse for the person sitting in the store with my order waiting for a driver so late when. I couldn’t even contact them directly to say cancel it mate it’s way to late to be waiting for drivers now.",1
173,2021-11-07,NSW,Another order cancelled after 90 minutes,"We need an alternative to Uber they just keep cancelling and the third time this week. They tell you it will be there in 50 minutes, extend that to 60 minutes and then 75 and 90 minutes and then cancel.",1
174,2021-11-06,VIC,Why is Uber Eats taking payment from my wrong account???,I have my PayPal set up and my credit card as my preferred primary method of payment but Uber keeps taking it out of my bank account even though I'm selecting PayPal?? There is no money in this account and it is set up just for my PayPal deposits. Why is this happening?? I can't find anyone to contact for this issue!!! I don't understand why Uber is taking the funds out of my bank account when my credit card is set up as my preferred method of payment for PayPal!! So annoyed as my bank is charging me dishonor fees!!! Can someone please contact me about this!!,1
175,2021-11-06,,Slow deliveries to increase Uber profits,"Same as most ppl here. I waited 2 hours to get my food. (Restaurant is a 5 minute drive). Food was ready in good time but Uber delays allocating a driver until someone else orders going the same way… then you wait for that guys food to be cooked & then delivered. Then they drop your food off, cold & very very late. Complaints department is a joke, just total waste of time. I will be avoiding Uber eats going forward",1
176,2021-11-06,QLD,Never again!,We have eaten many times at the restaurant and know there standards! The restaurant is great.,1
177,2021-11-06,,"Expensive, late and Inedible","I placed and Uber Eats order cause I was working from home. The store was 10km away. Obviously you pay a bit more for it to be delivered to you, I also paid for priority and a 20% tip. It was estimated to take an hour, fair enough. Two hours passed and no one took up the order. Eventually someone picked it up and brought it to me home. By then the food was cold and inedible. If you cannot deliver on a service within a timeframe then you should just refund rather than have the driver deliver a crappy meal.",1
178,2021-11-06,TAS,Absolutely poor service,Had legs and breasts deliver last night the driver left it at the door did knock 1 hour later the meal was found cold and due to chicken left that long outside cause my son to vomit. Won’t ever use them again nor leg and breast who said nobody else got sick. No because their meal wasn’t sitting outside for an hour.,1
179,2021-11-05,,Too expensive. Better to order directly from restaurant.,Ordered food from Lokka food truck. Extra $6 charged for each item and I paid total $24 extra. Should have ordered through the restaurant’s  web site. Will never use uber eats again.,1
180,2021-11-05,,Gotten too big for their boots,"Long time user, but now refunds for poor food have been met with resistance, drivers make multiple stops and oddly “aren’t available” at peak times without a surcharge. I’m done.",1
181,2021-11-04,,"Takes your money, doesn’t deliver. 2 hours late cancel","Uber is completely lost it’s value to consumers.The last 4 times I have ordered Uber eats, they take the order, take your money, push the time out. Then cancel the order 2 hours later then you have to wait 10 days for a refund.No customer service, you can’t contact them. Absolute terrible company.",1
182,2021-11-04,,Absolutely a rip off,You pay for a service they don't provide.Terms and conditions basically tell you to pay and then get what you're given and suck it up.Zero customer service. The drivers are the scum of the earth.,1
183,2021-11-04,NSW,Order placed 6:45 - cold food received 8:15,Really upsetting and disappointing.,1
184,2021-11-02,VIC,Worst service ever,"Waited 75 mins for food order got cancelled, waited 45 mins on hold system cancelled the hold as they took to long. Crap and should stop operating until ACCC investigated there false advertising",1
185,2021-11-02,VIC,Disgusting and inedible food,I ordered Mac Donald’s through Uber eats the delivery time kept blowing out so tried to cancel and was told the food had been made and that they were waiting for a driver  I could cancel but would be charged still . The driver arrived at the store 20-30 minutes later then to us the food was absolutely disgusting not even fit for the dog and the whole lot went in the bin $60 worth . Do not use there service it’s a ripoff and the quality is terrible,1
186,2021-11-01,,Wait times too long,"Food is always cold by the time it arrives, wait times are usually an hour, shops are waiting for drivers to arrive. Worst service ever. Doing multiple pick ups and deliveries is frustrating.",1
187,2021-11-01,NSW,They have never got any of my orders correct,They said they would refund me on items I did not receive yet they never did refund me and it’s impossible to get hold of them!!! There has not been 1 order that has ever been correct!! Then I couldn’t get into my Uber account as it would accept my password and when they emailed me to reset my password and when I went into the account my orders were gone from there,1
188,2021-10-31,NSW,Terrible service,I just had by UberEats order cancelled after waiting for two hours.  This is not the first time - no apology given - no notice given (it just says the order is delivered and charges $0)  - no care or courtesy - am now deleting the app - clearly they do not need my business!,1
189,2021-10-31,,Never again.,"They accept orders when restaurant is closing so the order never arrives. This has happened already a few times, specially on sunday evenings when there are no options. Bye uber eats..",1

In 2020, due to COVID I thought I will drive for Uber eats again and earn some money while everyone is locked inside. I have been trying to reactivate an already existing account from the last 10 months and even till today I am struggling. Their staff doesn’t know half of things, their app doesn’t help you much even in their help tab. Worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life has been with just activatin...",1
192,2021-10-30,,Delivered in reasonable time - food still hot!,"Placed the order and it was delivered in under 30 minutes.  Food was unmolested, bag unopened and I was kept informed of the package progress from collection to delivery.  This is a service worth paying for.",5

My Mango Freezy appeared to not be full to the brim like it normally is yet the second straw provided was in the plastic bag with the food? Why is one straw in one drink but the other straw in the bag?The bag of chips were missing and the food was cold.Last time im ordering through Uber Eats, I found their rival MEnulog is better because you can also call and speak to an actual consultant to advise of any isues with their order.",1
194,2021-10-29,,Shut this garbage service down,"What is the point of offering food delivery, if there are either never any drivers available, or when there are, they rack the food and never deliver it. Just cook your own dinner.",1

I called the uber delivery guy to correct this but he advised that I have to go through Uber eats. I call the restaurant to say I will pick it up instead. They told me they will only give it to the Uber eats collection guy and not me. If I needed to change the address, I must do it online. I attempted to change it online, but it was too late. I had a choice of cancelling or keeping the same address. I cancelled. I...",1
199,2021-10-27,,terrible,"Ordered a meal from a nearby restaurant. Food was cooked and ready to go within 30 minutes. The delivery driver waa waiting another restaurant for another order to be ready prior to picking up mine, causing my meal to sit there and get cold for 30 minutes.

200,2021-10-26,VIC,drivers stealing food i have paid for and ubereats letting them get away with it,no phone number to contact when food doesn't arrive - restaurant tells us to contact ubereats but they are not contactable. we are left with only half our order - 2 people going hungry and no one wants to fix it,1
201,2021-10-26,VIC,Scammers,They charge an exorbitant service fee in addition to delivery fee. Delivery is the service you're providing! This is a ridiculous scam that's taking advantage of the pandemic and people's need to order in the lockdown.,1
202,2021-10-25,,Worst invention of app,"Not once but multiple times I have had the worst and traumatic experience in my life because of Uber. Sometimes it was driver being offensive, rude many many times, made me feel unsafe. They were the traumatic event of my entire life which wouldn’t have happened if I hadn’t used Uber. On the other hand Uber eats, worst customer service ever, they talk to you like they are paying you to order food, pathetic explanation of things, numerous unsolved or unsatisfied solution. Worst, traumatic and crap experience ever. Please do not use this crap.",1

204,2021-10-24,QLD,Worst delivery service ever!,"Food always takes over an hour, food is usually cold by the time it arrives. They just do not care they’re too big for their boots now. Drivers are usually rude too and threaten to drive off if you try to communicate they’re in the wrong place! Use another more boutique delivery service in your area if you need to but if you can go directly to the shop do that instead.",1
205,2021-10-24,QLD,Do yourself a favour and remove the app,Uber eats is a disgrace first they inflate the food prices then charge a service fee as well as delivery fee then they do deliveries on the way and take forever so the food is cold or not what you ordered I have been able to get a full refund twice after finding the confusing complaints procedure I’m over it and will never use it again,1
206,2021-10-24,,2 hours after ordering they cancelled,I waited almost 2 hours. They kept changing the delivery time and then cancelled my order. This isn’t the first time this has happened. Now my family are starving. UberEats service is worse than Telstra and that’s an achievement.,1

Within 5 minutes I went back in to add that I would meet the driver, when the system then stated that delivery was no longer available. I cancelled this order and then ordered elsewhere.
